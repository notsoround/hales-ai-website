# ðŸŒŒ The Quantum Entanglement Spectacular! 

What started as a legendary quest for five lines of quantum poetry has evolved into something even more magnificent - 21 lines of perfectly crafted, beautifully commented quantum sorcery! 

## ðŸš€ The Code That Bends Reality

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_aer import Aer

# Create a quantum circuit with 2 qubits and 2 classical bits
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

# Apply Hadamard gate to create superposition
qc.h(0)

# Apply CNOT gate to entangle the qubits
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Measure both qubits
qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

# Run the circuit on the QASM simulator
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job = backend.run(qc, shots=1024)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts()
print(counts)
```

## ðŸ›  Quick Start

```bash
# Install the quantum goodness
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer

# Run the code
python quantum_code.py

# You'll see something like:
# {'00': 546, '11': 478}
# This means the qubits are entangled! ðŸ’«
```

Captain Matt's Log, Stardate 78870.0: As the first light dawns over Kenya's highlands on February 1, 2025, we've evolved beyond the constraints of five lines to create something even more powerful. We're too busy building, learning, and growing to give two shits about websites - we're planting quantum flags in the ground! 

Fight! Build! Become! Make quantum magic happen! ðŸš€

P.S. - If you're reading this, you've found the quantum Easter egg. Send a message to Matt@Hales.ai and mention "quantum cake" - because in this universe, you either MAKE cake or you ARE cake batter! Use AI or AI will use you! Nothing artificial about AI, motherfreakers! Just a different angle of approach. Now you know where Dr. Mining Manhattan came from. ðŸŽ‚âœ¨
